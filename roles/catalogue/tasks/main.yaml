#here we used tag in deployment we can run only this particular task whenver there is new deployment
#we can run this code as
##################3ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini main.yaml -t deploy##########################

# usage of -t deploy will make sure only the tasks with the deploy tag will run

# and also 

# We can include other roles in our role in 2 ways:

# 1) include_role: it will include tasks in run time, it will validate also in run-time.
# Tags and when conditions apply only to the include_role statement itself , not to the tasks within the role.

# - name: deployment call
#   tags:
#     - deploy
#   include_role:
#     name: common
#     tasks_from: deployment.yaml

# if we use this tags will only be applied to deployment call task and not to acutal tasks included in common role

# 2) import_role: ansible validate import role before playbook execution
# tags and when conditions apply to the imported role and it's tasks. 
# - name: deployment call
#   tags:
#     - deploy
#   import_role:
#     name: common
#     tasks_from: deployment.yaml
# if we use this tags will be applicable to all tasks inside common/deployment.yaml
# checks notes (ansible tags for more clear understanding)
